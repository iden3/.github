# Identity protocol 

## Prove your access rights, not your identity

iden3 is a next-generation private access control based on self-sovereign identity, designed for decentralised and trust-minimised environments.

## Privacy for all

Everyone has the right to liberty and equality, the right freely to participate in their community, and the right to privacy.

The aim of the iden3 protocol is to empower people and create a more inclusive and egalitarian foundation for better human relationships through open-source cryptography and decentralised technologies.
